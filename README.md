# smart-traffic-controller-verilog
This project implements a Smart Traffic Controller using Verilog HDL to efficiently manage traffic flow at an intersection. The design utilizes a finite state machine (FSM) to control traffic lights based on real-time conditions such as vehicle presence and predefined timing rules.
